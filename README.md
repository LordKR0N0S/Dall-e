I'm proud to have created my first full-stack project - a cutting-edge MERN app that generates AI-powered images. The front-end is built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, while the back-end uses Node.js with Express.js. For data storage, I utilized MongoDB.

Completing this project has given me an even greater passion for web development, as well as a deeper understanding of the technologies involved. I'm excited to continue building my skills and exploring new opportunities in this dynamic field.
